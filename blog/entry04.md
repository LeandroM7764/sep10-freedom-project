# SEP10 Freedom Project
##### By Leandro

Hi, I'm Leandro, currently enrolled in the Software Engineering Program at HSTAT. As part of my SEP10 project, named the "Freedom Project," I've embarked on a significant year long task which was creating a website. This platform aims to serve as a hub for sharing insights and updates on advancements in my chosen field of interest.

My focus area for this project is Space Exploration.

Throughout the process of developing this website, I utilized HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Github. Additionally, I delved into independent research on Space Exploration to ensure that the content on my site is informative and engaging.
